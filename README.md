# How to do the initial setup
So for the windows workinng environment you need to install the following :
1. Visual Studio Code
2. C++ extension and Code Runner extension
3. G++ /  MinGw

Use youtube for help


### Or
Perhaps you need a single shot method to run the c++ code then ill suggest using the DevC++
